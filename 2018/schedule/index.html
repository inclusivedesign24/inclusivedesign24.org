        <h3>About the speakers</h4>
        <div class="session_presenter_bio">
            <p>Bruce is a web standards consultant, most recently for Wix Engineering. He’s been involved in web standards since 2002 (which is why he looks that bad). He was in the Web Standards Project’s Accessibility Task Force, was a member of the W3C Mobile Best Practices Working Group and co-authored the first full-length book on HTML5</p>
            <p>Seren is a Software Engineer on the ecommerce team at Elsevier. In between co-organising <cite>JSOxford</cite> and promoting accessibility she can be found doing the occasional bit of nail art. Seren was included in <cite>Code First: Girls</cite>' <cite>Ones to Watch 2018</cite>, and won a <cite>Rising Star Award for Technology 2018</cite> from <cite>We Are The City</cite></p>

            <p>Web accessibility is often considered overwhelming and complex due to the intricate interactions between users, guidelines, code, browsers, and assistive technologies. Exploring these complex layers of accessibility, and understanding how ARIA impacts them, can give a much simpler and more powerful approach to accessibility.</p>

        <div class="session_abstract">
            <p>The Web can be an invaluable resource for users with trauma and stressor related disorders. Online support groups, for example, can provide a certain degree of anonymity, flexible participation and in cases where local expertise or support is not present, the Internet may be a person's primary resource for both peer and professional support. In addition, online education provides various communities, which may have been exposed to trauma, the ability to obtain or continue higher education goals or other forms of training. Given the potential benefits offered by the Internet to serve this group of users, there is little existing research or accessibility guidance on inclusion or the mitigation of barriers specific to the needs of this group of users. This presentation looks at studies, existing frameworks, and ideas that may lead to a better online experiences for people with trauma related disorders.</p>

            <p>Wordpress has grown from just a blogging platform to a full-fledged content management system with the ability to build complex portals. At the same time, the Wordpress team has put in a lot of efforts to make the platform accessible. Perhaps Wordpress is the only content management system that claims to be Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.0 complaint. The Wordpress team is very committed to accessibility. Another reason for the popularity of Wordpress is that the platform is pretty easy to manage even with less technical knowledge. Though usage of Wordpress has grown, not many users are leveraging the accessibility features that come out of the box. This presentation discusses how to build accessible websites using Wordpress.</p>

We like charts because we tend to perceive graphical information faster than plain text. But what about people with visual impairments? How do they get information from charts? Is it even possible to make charts for everybody? Definitely yes! In this presentation I will guide you through real world examples and identify solutions and best practices for making charts accessible.</p>

        <div class="session_abstract">
            <p>This is the story of a developer who loved JavaScript tools that streamlined their day to day development work and made them super productive. One day this developer heard about accessibility and started looking for some information. There were many examples, but none in their framework. There were many opinions, often conflicting each other. There were many documents, most very long and complicated. And then there was a five word message on Twitter one day: “Your framework is not accessible!”. Jaded, this developer closed the chapter on accessibility and kept building websites the only way they knew how, telling everyone in their team how expensive an accessibility conversion will be. In this talk we will imagine a different future. One where they find powerful accessible examples, clear references and a welcoming accessibility community. One where they see how accessibility benefits everyone, including them. One we can work towards.</p>

            <p>In the current times, we work globally and are often creating products for an international audience. In this process, we also need to communicate with people from different cultures. However, we might not be embracing the cultural differences fully. We as designers, as organisations, as people have a lot to think about and act upon - How can we be naturally more inclusive? How do we get past the stereotypes? How do we build awareness about differences? How do we embrace the rich diversity that we have around us?</p>

When vulnerable we may need a different experience, different support or  restrictions in how we use a product. In this talk we'll explore what we mean by vulnerable circumstances, look at how we could build in friction for those who find themselves vulnerable and look at examples of good practice in this space.</p>

        <div class="session_abstract">
            <p>This project seeks to enable people with an intellectual disability and physical impairments, to perform cooking tasks in a safe and controlled environment. This co-design research project, seeks to provide additional interactivity and safety during cooking tasks, by developing (primarily through consultation with service users and support staff) additional autonomous sensors that can provide valuable additional context information (such as the weight of the product, the presence of smoke or fumes in the cooking area) that would not otherwise be available to a cooking appliance. The intention of this project titled "Sensor+" is an evolution of components that could be used in "smart" cooking appliances. The aim is to ensure safe and successful outcomes for service users -who use the appliance, and therefore increase their confidence in cooking independently.</p>
            <p>By including these additional external support sensors in the context of "interactive recipes" it will facilitate "fading" of assistance feature of the smart cooking appliance while also raising awareness among service users about the possible effect of cooking parameters.</p>
            <p>We worked with service users and Staff from Saint John of God Community Services to develop autonomous external sensors that will provide additional "eyes and ears" for the smart cooking appliance, to ensure that the correct path is being followed by a service user who is using the appliance. This work required a modest number of face-to-face interactions with service users and support staff.</p>
            <p>The target group include different people who experience different levels of difficulties in using various cooking systems, with a particularly low grade of autonomy in preparing foods and meals. The group provided information on current challenges, share current technology solutions that work affectively in other areas. They were involved in the co-design of the product and asked for feedback at regular intervals throughout the project lifecycle.</p>

            <p>Design systems are a popular way for teams to flavor their design and development workflow. However, an often-missing ingredient in many design systems is a focus on accessibility best practices — especially when component libraries are involved. In this talk, we’ll take a look at how you can season some commonly-used components with accessibility. Pair this with accessibility guidance in your documentation, and you’ll have the recipe for a delectably inclusive design system.</p>

            <p>Design is problem solving. Each and every day, we are tasked with finding ways to reduce the friction our users experience on the Web. That means streamlining flows, reducing cognitive load, writing more appropriate copy, and (of course) building accessible experience. But experience is about more than just interface. Our users’ experiences begin with their first request to our servers. In this intensely practical session, Aaron will explore the ins and outs of page load performance by showing how he made the web site of the 10K Apart meet its own contest rules, by having a site that was functional and attractive even without JavaScript, and was less than ten kilobytes at initial load. You’ll walk away with a better understanding of the page load process as well as numerous ways you can improve the projects you are working on right now.</p>
