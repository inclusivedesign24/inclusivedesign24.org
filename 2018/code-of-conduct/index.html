<h3>Purpose</h3>
<p>This Code of Conduct describes what we expect from everyone who participates in #id24, and describes what will happen when someone breaks the Code of Conduct.</p>

<p>This Code of Conduct also applies to unacceptable behaviour outside of #id24, when such behaviour has the potential to affect the safety and well-being of #id24 participants.</p>

<h3>Recognition</h3>
<p>We want everyone to understand the relationship between their words and actions, and the way the #id24 community works together.</p>
<p>We encourage everyone to take deliberate and positive actions, so the #id24 community does not have the same types of inequality found in society.</p>
<p>If you notice someone who is making an extra effort to make the #id24 community friendly and welcoming, compliment them for their good work. You can do this personally, or by letting the #id24 organisers know.</p>

<li>Recognise others who make an extra effort to make #id24 friendly, welcoming, and who encourage others to take part.</li>
<li>Be mindful of your surroundings, and of your fellow participants.</li>
