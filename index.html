    <!--<a class="videostream" target="_blank" href="" aria-describedby="talk6"><i class="fa fa-play-circle" aria-hidden="true"></i> View video/stream</a>-->
    <div class="session_details">
        <div class="session_abstract">The PhET Interactive Simulations project makes award winning science simulations (or sims) for learning math and science. These sims are accessible in many ways: engaging and easy to use, translated into 91 languages, openly licensed and free of cost, can be run online or offline, and have broad device compatibility. These popular learning tools are, however, completely inaccessible to students who are blind. Through an iterative inclusive design process we are redesigning PhET sims so that they are navigable and usable with a keyboard. We have created a layer of architecture that is not only keyboard accessible but also houses semantically rich descriptions that transform the same visual sim into one that provides a comparable non-visual experience, so students who are blind can learn alongside their sighted peers with a more inclusive sim.

        <h4>About the speaker</h4>
        <div class="session_presenter_bio">Taliesin Smith is an inclusive design research specialist with the PhET Interactive Simulations project at the University of Colorado Boulder.

In 2016, she completed a Masters of Design in Inclusive Design at OCAD University in Toronto, Canada for which she was awarded the Canadian Governor General's Academic Gold Medal. Her Masters research project focused on the research and design of accessibility features to provide non-visual access for the PhET Simulation, Balloons and Static Electricity, and received the Inclusive Design Research Award at OCAD University. Taliesin loves to bike, hike, and garden when she is not at her computer.

    <div class="session_details">
        <div class="session_abstract">Those who want to make accessible websites, will likely spend some of their time convincing others. One good reason to make accessible websites is that doing so _is the right thing_. For centuries, doing the right thing has been a concern for the field of philosophical ethics. In this talk, some notable philosophical thought experiments are applied to the world of web accessibility. With some practical examples, this talk makes a refreshing case for web accessibility, which people can use to advocate for more inclusive websites.

        <div class="session_presenter_bio">Gunnar is a web design technologist, f/k/a frontend developer who cares more about user experience, inclusive design, accessibility, interaction design, performance, and typography than about the next shiny framework. He loves HTML code with as less divs as possible. He loves CSS magic over throwing JavaScript at styling. He loves Bruce Springsteen songs and plays one or two of them on guitar.

            <p>In this session, we examine the "NC State Accessibility Helper", a homegrown WordPress plugin that helps address these issues at NC State University.

            <p>Organisations typically consider Accessibility to be something that comes into play  in the testing phase of the software accessibility life cycle. When accessibility is approached as an afterthought at the end of the software development life cycle, it is very likely to incur unnecessary additional costs and workload for the company because accessibility has not been embedded in every phase of the process. For example, if a design problem is identified in the testing phase, the page needs to be redesigned, implemented and tested again, which can cause more costs for the company.</p>
            <p>In this talk, AbilityNet consultants will discuss the challenges of including accessibility in every phase of the software development process, the methods that can be used to improve accessibility in each phase and the individuals and teams that should be involved in each phase.</p>

        <div class="session_abstract">Who would win in a showdown between HTML Links and Buttons? Marcy Sutton will settle it once and for all by pitting these opponents against each other in a dream match. Battles as simple as links vs. buttons when designing and developing web interfaces can have significant impacts on users with disabilities. By considering the strengths of each competitor, we can be more informed about making the right choice; from lesser-known features of HTML forms to conventions in client-side routing to effective use of WAI-ARIA. We can also mitigate scenarios where neither choice wins by knockout. Come for the showdown, leave with practical UI tips for your next project.

In this talk, we will take a look at common problems of the web today and demonstrate how we can make it a more welcoming place.

        <h4>About the speaker</h4>
        <div class="session_presenter_bio">While pursuing an MLIS during my employment at a rural Alaska public library, I rediscovered my interest in web design. Four years ago, I landed my dream job with the State of Alaska as a web designer. For the past four years now I've been enveloped in the world of web development without giving up my support for the world of libraries, archives, and museums. I strongly believe that everyone should have access to information for personal and professional improvement, and that access does not need to be comprised just because we want pretty websites and modern applications. When I'm not dreaming up designs or picking through code, I'm spending time with my husband and preschooler.

  <p>Barclays is a Transatlantic Consumer, Corporate and Investment bank with an ambition to become the most accessible and inclusive company in the FTSE100.</p>
  <p>Building accessibility awareness and technical expertise across its workforce is a core part of Barclays strategy to meet its ambition. Inclusive Design 24 provides an excellent opportunity to do this. Speaking about their involvement, Paul Smyth (Head of IT Accessibility at Barclays) said:</p>
  <blockquote><p>ID24 has grown in reach and impact over recent years and we’re really proud to be supporting this brilliant global event. We recognise the need to move the accessibility agenda away from being solely focused on compliance and checklists towards being much more rounded, user focused and experience led. We believe this means that we need an accessibility community with a hybrid skill-set – of technical expertise, ability to deliver change and confidence and curiosity in consulting with diverse users. If professionals grow holistic skills and if organisations shift their accessibility mind-set beyond compliance, we can design excellent, accessible and inclusive experiences. ID24 provides a great opportunity for everyone to engage and learn more about a broad range of accessibility and inclusive design topics.</p></blockquote>
