    <div class="session_details">
        <div class="session_abstract"><p>You may think accessible media players have nothing to do with you but in a world where over 65% of all search results are video even if you are not creating media players you may well be embedding them in your web pages, commissioning them and almost certainly using them on a daily basis. This is not a talk about HTML5 video, WCAG, compliance or codecs however. This is a talk about making video and audio content discoverable, fun and usable for diverse users by exploring the key principles of accessible user experience that should be applied across all digital products.</p>

    <div class="session_details">
        <div class="session_abstract"><p>Improving web accessibility can be challenging, particularly for organizations with large, complex digital estates and internal organizational structures. Efforts can be guided by technical standards, but there are shortcomings with treating accessibility for people with disabilities as a compliance effort. What if we take a process-oriented approach to accessibility, focusing on making a commitment and demonstrating progress? In this session we explore an approach to improving digital accessibility that places value on conscious, pragmatic decision-making and sharing of evidence of progress.</p>

    <div class="session_details">
        <div class="session_abstract"><p>In this talk, I will work on the two disciplines that have come together to ensure that an individual user is able to find a resource in a format that is usable to them. This takes into account WCAG and ideas of universal design etc but it also takes account of an interpretation of the UN's Convention on the Rights of People with Disabilities that favours inclusion as a way of avoiding discrimination and it involves taking advantage of work that has been done for decades now to make matching of requirements with user's needs. Users' needs come in the form of semantic needs, finding a resource that is relevant to their interest, and accessibility, being sure that the resource will actually be usable by them. This work has led to developments in both accessibility and metadata, as will be explained.</p>

    <div class="session_details">
        <div class="session_abstract"><p>Why are aesthetics so often the enemy of accessibility, and how can we change that? Laura will explore the pillars of aesthetic design on the web: typography, colour, layout, and form, and how they affect accessibility.

    <div class="session_details">
        <div class="session_abstract"><p>Along with visual design, defining how assistive technology users interact with a web page or application is a user experience concern, but is often not considered along with other user experience and design issues. Additionally, structure and order of content can be the foundation of the user experience for keyboard and screen reader users but is often not thought about at the design stage. This talk covers a checklist of user experience and design aspects that should be considered and documented in any project.</p>

    <div class="session_details">
        <div class="session_abstract"><p>Studies indicate that people with disabilities tend to be in poorer health and receive less proactive care than other patient groups. Too few clinical practices provide adequate accommodation, and providers increasingly deem those with disabilities an economic drain due to their advanced medical histories. Disability is also a contributing factor to the decreasing availability of healthy, affordable food among today's low-income populations. These are fundamental human needs that should be more accessible to people most at risk, and the reality is they aren't. But we can do something about it. This presentation will examine the digital, cultural and societal aspects of health literacy for people with disabilities. We'll explore the gaps that exist in today's e-health landscape, uncovering the ways that accessibility can bring universal benefit to people of all abilities and backgrounds.</p>
