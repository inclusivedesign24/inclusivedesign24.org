        <div class="session_abstract"><p>Let's geek out about two things many of us love: comics and accessibility! The comics medium is incredibly expressive, but because it's so visual, it often ignores audiences with vision impairments. How can we make comics a more inclusive medium that everyone can enjoy? In this talk, we'll examine some existing techniques, like transcription, and discuss some new and innovative ways of creating non-visual comics from the outset.</p>

        <div class="session_abstract"><p>Inclusive game design is as difficult as it is valuable. Here’s why: we usually make software accessible for people with disabilities by removing barriers and reducing friction, but being challenged (conflict + resolution) is why we play games. In this talk, we’ll take examples of friction in gaming, examine them with an inclusive design lens, and show how we can tailor the experiences to make them playable without sacrificing what makes games fun.</p>

        <div class="session_abstract"><p>Inclusive design is about putting people first. It's about designing for the needs of people with permanent, temporary, situational, or changing disabilities – all of us really. These principles are a springboard for taking your products beyond accessibility, making them intuitive and easy to use for disabled people while showcasing beautiful design for all.</p>
          <p>They are intended for use by anyone involved in the design and development of websites and applications: designers, user experience professionals, developers, product owners, idea makers, innovators, artists and thinkers. They are intended for use in the design process to help ensure teams create products that are flexible and accommodating.</p>
          <p>Henny will walk you through the reasons why the team – Léonie Watson, Ian Pouncey, Heydon Pickering and herself – put these principles together, how they inform the design process, and share some examples and stories to illustrate each.<p>

        <div class="session_abstract"><p>Today/tonight, let’s talk about trains and digital accessibility here in France. To do so, I will be joined by two ladies who have done a tremendous job for digital accessibility awareness within the French railway company.  Together, we worked on the certification of 20 websites with contributors spread all around France and many PDF documents to deal with. We will share with you some tips and good practices, like the typical processes we have used for most of our projects to ensure accessibility from the start to the end of the project. To put it shortly ? This talk will be the perfect opportunity to get behind the scenes of a client - service provider relationship in the field of web accessibility.</p>

        <h4>About the speakers</h4>
        <div class="session_presenter_bio"><p>Florian has been working as a digital accessibility expert for almost 2 years at <a href="http://www.sncf.com/">SNCF</a>. In 2016, he joined <a href="http://access42.net">Access42</a>, the consulting company in charge of writing the reference document about digital accessibility for the French government. Florian is now working as an expert on many projects for the French railway company, guiding a few of them through the French certification process.</p>
          <p>Aurélie is in charge of developing the checkout process for the SNCF regional railway websites and mobile applications. She discovered digital accessibility when redesigning these websites 5 years ago. She decided the project must be inclusive and certified with the AA level of the French regulation, which the sites obtained last year. Since then, she has been lobbying for digital accessibility awareness within the railway company.</p>
          <p>Nathalie is in charge of e-commercialising annual season tickets for SNCF regional railway services. Following Aurélie’s footsteps, in early January 2017, she launched a website featuring personal customer’s account. This enabled each subscriber to manage its contract autonomously. The website is designed to be accessible to all users.</p>

    <div class="session_details">
        <div class="session_abstract"><p>Why should we focus on usability instead of accessibility? Because accessibility is about people. And as superfluous as it may sound it is still necessary to keep telling this to ourselves everyday. When deadlines approach and budgets get more tight it is difficult to maintain the right focus. It is very convenient then to have a long list of todo’s that you can tick off. Which is how WCAG often are seen: A long list of obligations. So how do we keep the right focus when we need to juggle budgets, deadlines, fantastic designs and advanced techniques? By seeing accessibility for what it really is: usability. And to do so we need the right tools and some guidance. This talk will provide you with the latter. Because the right guides are the most important tools you need.</p>

        <div class="session_abstract"><p>Digital access is about more than standards, testing, and policy.  It’s also about the civil rights of disabled people who need accessibility to participate fully in 21st century society.  In the United States, legal advocacy recognizes digital accessibility as a civil right.  Designed for folks in the accessibility trenches, this session will be a fast paced review of how the law has increased accessibility and usability of the digital space – and what’s ahead given the current political climate.</p>

        <h4>About the speaker</h4>
        <div class="session_presenter_bio"><p>Birkir is the real (from a genetic point of view) accessibility Viking (even if he believes <a href="http://www.karlgroves.com/">Karl Groves</a> has earned an honorary title of accessibility Viking). Born as a result of 800 years of Icelandic inbreading he lost his sight due to a genetic defect at age 5. Since then he has never looked back (after all, how could he?).</p>
          <p>After graduating from Yale University with degrees in Computer Science and Economics, and spending 7 years working as a financial analyst for two banks who both failed spectacularly, he turned his attention to accessibility, partly as a result of not having being able to come up with materials for the Certified Financial Analyst (CFA) degree. After working for various Icelandic and European accessibility forces, mostly for the light side, and 3 years at <a href="https://www.deque.com/">Deque Systems</a>, he took on an accessibility lead position at <a href="https://www.bbt.com/">BB&amp;T Bank</a>, one which he has held for almost a year now. In his job he leads the accessibility efforts of the USA's 6th largest financial institution, not a trivial task, but he enjoys it.</p>
