<h2>Hello #id24 presenters!</h2>

<p>As #id24 approaches, we’ve put together a few bits and pieces for you to help you prepare for the big day.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Please check the time of your talk once again. #id24 runs on UTC/GMT, so depending on where in the world you are, your talk may be at a different time (on Wednesday not Thursday for example). The <a href="https://inclusivedesign24.org/">#id24 website</a> will show the time of your talk based on the time zone you’re currently in.</li>
  <li>Please be online and connected to your skype at least 15 minutes before your talk is due to start, and have your slides ready to go promptly on the hour. Your host will share your hangout URL with you at that time.</li>
  <li>Please keep to time. #id24 talks run for 40 minutes with a 10-minute question period at the end. We have to allow a 10-minute change-over between talks for the captioners and hosts. To keep #id24 running smoothly, we’ll be strict about finishing talks (including questions) inside of 50 minutes, but it is also important that your talk does not stop too far short of 40 minutes in order to avoid unexpectedly long breaks between talks.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Hangouts</h2>

<p>We use Google Hangouts via YouTube live. Because of how this is set up, the host will start the hangout at 10 minutes to the hour, and invite the other participants to join via a URL.</p>

<ul>
<li>Please complete a tech check on Monday, Tuesday, or Wednesday (before the start of #id24). We will have open Hangouts running all week for speakers to join. If you’d like an invite, just ping one of the #id24 team in the #id24 Skype channel.</li>
  <li>Do not “Add” attendees from the Hangout URLs. Attendees/viewers will watch via YouTube or via the publicly published URLs on the #id24 site.</li>
</ul>

<p>If you haven’t already, please:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Let us have your Skype ID so we can add you to the presenter’s Skype chat channel. This is the place to ask questions and get help between now and the end of #id24 from the #id24 team members.</li>
  <li>If you are unfamiliar with Hangouts on Air, see <a href="https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/2474026?hl=en">YouTube Help: Introduction to live streaming</a>.</li>
  <li>We’ll be asking people to use Twitter and the <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/#id24q">#id24q hashtag</a> to ask questions.</li>
  <li>We’ll be available right up until Wednesday evening (EST) to walk anyone through hangouts should you need help. Ping us either via <a href="mailto:team@inclusivedesign24.org">email</a> or on Skype and we’ll be happy to assist you.</li>
</ol>

<p>Things to note:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Google Hangouts does not play well with video content unless it is hosted on YouTube (it buffers and gets “choppy”). We strongly recommend avoiding video content in your presentation.</li>
  <li>When co-presenting with other people, swapping control of the slides between different people often causes logistical problems. We strongly recommend that only one prsenter has responsibility for controlling the slides.</li>
  <li>Please turn off all notifications (text messages, social media, Skype etc.) during your presentation.</li>
  <li>Please avoid live coding during your talk.</li>
 <li>Hangouts will be moderated by at least two people including one #id24 team member. These teams will be responsible for fielding any questions on twitter and will ask them to you at the end of your talk. These moderators will be silent for the duration of your talk unless there is a reason for them to interrupt you (for example, if your screen stops sharing or there are connectivity issues)</li>
  <li>The #id24 moderators will also be responsible for starting and stopping the broadcast. At the beginning of the session they will “Go live” and you can share your screen. They will then mute themselves and the floor will be yours!</li>
</ol>

<h2>Spread the word!</h2>

<p>We need your help spreading the word about #id24 around the world. Please share the #id24 schedule with all your contacts, using the <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/#id24">#id24 hashtag</a> where appropriate
<a href="https://inclusivedesign24.org">https://inclusivedesign24.org</a></p>

<h2>Thank you</h2>

<p>With thanks to our Partners Barclays Access, we are able to offer a modest fee for each session. To help us process payment as efficiently as possible, please send a single invoice per session to <a href="mailto:hello@inclusivedesign24.org">hello@inclusivedesign24.org</a>. Please mark the invoice with the following details:</p>

<ul>

<li>Address: 5 Pine street extension, #6 Annex Unit 2-F, Nashua, NH, 03060</li>
<li>Details: Inclusive Design 24 presentation fee XYZ (where XYZ is the name of your presentation)</li>
</ul>

<p>Most importantly - have fun!</p>

<p>Thanks for being part of #id24. If there is anything else we can do to help, you know where to find us, if not - best of luck!</p>
