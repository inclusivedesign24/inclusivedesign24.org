        <div class="session_abstract">
            As web developers, we are after the best user experience possible. This is a refrain that most will acknowledge. “The Tipping Point: How Performance Decisions Make Accessibility Differences” looks at how performance best practices can in help bring you closer to the accessibility resolution. We’ll see at how resource management will help reduce wait time anti-patterns, how Time To Interactive and other metrics can aid in improving a page’s usability, and how other best practices ultimately directly and positively affect accessibility.

            <p>Digital accessibility can be difficult or frustrating to a lot of people, but it doesn’t have to be. By making small changes to your everyday workflow, you can have a huge impact on making the digital world more inclusive - without crushing your creativity or sacrificing your sanity!</p><p>In this talk, we will walk-through the process of creating an accessible pattern from design to development, while focusing on accessibility best practices at each step. We will start with a wireframe/sketch, a process that into a design, translate the design into code, and finally, retest for accessibility. We will also talk about the different kinds of patterns out in the wild and which are the most accessible to the widest range of users.</p><p>The audience will leave the talk with a deeper understanding of accessibility best practices and will have take-away action items to help them start building their own accessible patterns!</p>

        <div class="session_presenter_bio">
            <p>Sam Latif was born in the UK, and is a first generation Scottish Pakistani.  She is blind and the passion for what she is doing at P&G has been inspired by the personal access challenges she has experienced as both a consumer and an employee.  Sam studied Marketing and Business Law at the University of Stirling in Scotland and began her career at P&G in IT.  She has lead IT transformations across multiple worldwide businesses (including Fragrances, Pampers, Olay and Gillette).</p><p>In 2015 Sam switched focus from running IT businesses to figuring what it would take to make P&G become the most accessible company for the consumers we are serving and was appointed as the company’s first Special Consultant for Inclusive Design.  During this time, Sam worked with the Herbal Essences business to explore how we could make it easier to help people tell the difference between shampoo and conditioner, especially in the shower when people are not wearing their corrective eyewear. It’s estimated that 79% of the population in the west wear corrective eyewear and so its quite hard for people to tell by sight alone our shampoo and conditioner bottles apart.</p><p>In February 2019, Sam was promoted to Associate Director and became P&G’s first Company accessibility Leader and is responsible for making P&G workplace, products and packaging and communications fully accessible to everyone.</p><p>Sam is married and has 3 kids, boy and girl twins aged 7 and a 10  year old boy.  Sam is enjoying the challenge of learning to play the piano and working out at the gym.</p>

            <p>The purpose of typography is to convey a message to an audience in an accessible way. Within any given typeface, certain shapes and styles will generally be more accessible to certain audiences. Unfortunately, by over-simplifying implementation, guidelines for accessible type tend to ignore the major components of better readability and legibility. In this talk, Eleni will walk us through the elements of an accessible typeface and typesetting, putting an emphasis on those which are targeted at visually-impaired readers, and the wider audience.</p>

            <p>Exclusion can take many forms.  We're familiar with how the physically and mentally disabled can be excluded from the experiences we treasure, such as online resources, but there is a large group who suffer such exclusion based on the poor choices they have made.  Some 2.3 million incarcerated Americans are excluded from the internet by law.  No Facebook.  No Google. No Wikipedia.  No email. Little online education.  No webinars like this.</p><p>This is the story of a group of inmates, some innovative prison authorities, and a gamble by a private sector company who all got together to overcome that exclusion.  Access2online was born two years ago as a joint venture between the public and private sectors to teach inmates how to audit websites for accessibility to the blind and the disabled, and then to earn their keep by producing reports and instructions for web designers to make their websites accessible.  We're talking about one of the first and only places in America where the words inmate, internet, and income are now used in the same sentence.</p><p>Let's listen to the stories of the excluded and how they struggled for a seat at their nation's digital table by giving the disabled a seat at the same table.</p>

            <p>Published in May 2018, WCAG 2.1 was the first major update to the WCAG standard in over 10 years. The update added a number of new Success Criteria primarily aimed at closing significant known gaps to address the needs of users with low vision, to address new concerns brought about by touch input and mobile screens, and to start to address the needs of people with cognitive disabilities.</p><p>One such new Success Criteria is SC 1.3.5 – Purpose of Controls.</p><p>But why? What are the real benefits of this requirement? How do I as a developer successfully meet that requirement? How and why did this Success Criteria come to be? As we started to ask people about their understanding of this requirement, there seemed to be some confusion. And confusion is never good.</p><p>In this presentation, John will do a deep-dive on SC 1.3.5: the history, the process, the blood-sweat-and-tears involved in getting a new Success Criteria through the WCAG process. We’ll look at the immediate benefit of this new Success Criteria today, as well as gain insight to the much larger goal that this Success Criteria kicks off. We’ll examine techniques (both current and future), and we’ll end up with a developer’s challenge – and there will be a prize!</p>

            <p>Cognitive disabilities are the most common type of disability but are often the hardest to understand. What do we need to consider to make sure we're not inadvertently excluding people? We'll look through the lens of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) to explore how differences in cognitive functions can affect usability on websites, and what we can do to improve the user experience for everyone.</p>
