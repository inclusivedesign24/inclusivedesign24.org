But how does that change affect accessibility? In this session we will cover both the advantages and pitfalls RWD can provide for an accessible experience. Which paradigms can we keep, which ones have to go, and which compromises will have to be made in order to make accessible responsive design work?</p>

        <div class="session_abstract"><p>Single-page applications(SPA) are increasingly common on the web. They are easy to set up, and the offer an improved user experience by not having to reload and re-render the entire UI for every new view. SPA's are inherently inaccessible, though, but with some foresight and understanding, the accessibility of these applications can be greatly improved. This talk will cover fundamental accessibility issues with single page applications, and offer working code and examples that you can use in your projects now.</p>

    <div class="session_details">
        <div class="session_abstract"><p>Improving web accessibility can be challenging, particularly for organizations with large, complex digital estates and internal organizational structures. Efforts can be guided by technical standards, but there are shortcomings with treating accessibility for people with disabilities as a compliance effort. What if we take a process-oriented approach to accessibility, focusing on making a commitment and demonstrating progress? In this session we explore an approach to improving digital accessibility that places value on conscious, pragmatic decision-making and sharing of evidence of progress.</p>

    <div class="session_details">
        <div class="session_abstract"><p>In this talk, I will work on the two disciplines that have come together to ensure that an individual user is able to find a resource in a format that is usable to them. This takes into account WCAG and ideas of universal design etc but it also takes account of an interpretation of the UN's Convention on the Rights of People with Disabilities that favours inclusion as a way of avoiding discrimination and it involves taking advantage of work that has been done for decades now to make matching of requirements with user's needs. Users' needs come in the form of semantic needs, finding a resource that is relevant to their interest, and accessibility, being sure that the resource will actually be usable by them. This work has led to developments in both accessibility and metadata, as will be explained.</p>

        <div class="session_abstract"><p>Along with visual design, defining how assistive technology users interact with a web page or application is a user experience concern, but is often not considered along with other user experience and design issues. Additionally, structure and order of content can be the foundation of the user experience for keyboard and screen reader users but is often not thought about at the design stage. This talk covers a checklist of user experience and design aspects that should be considered and documented in any project.</p>

User stories is an effective usability method that can be employed to develop applications that are optimized for user experience.</p>

        <div class="session_abstract"><p>Japan was an early adopter of WCAG 2.0. The Japanese national standard was published in 2004 for the first time. When the standard was revised in 2010, it included WCAG 2.0. We had big challenges and made serious efforts for the last 5 years to promote the revised standard. Though there is no legal obligation even for public sectors in Japan, there area number of good examples of websites trying to conform to the standard. Besides, Japan has a new law that will take effect in 2016. Makoto will share with you lessons learned from his experience and what is going to happen in Japan.</p>

    <div class="session_details">
        <div class="session_abstract"><p>Studies indicate that people with disabilities tend to be in poorer health and receive less proactive care than other patient groups. Too few clinical practices provide adequate accommodation, and providers increasingly deem those with disabilities an economic drain due to their advanced medical histories. Disability is also a contributing factor to the decreasing availability of healthy, affordable food among today's low-income populations. These are fundamental human needs that should be more accessible to people most at risk, and the reality is they aren't. But we can do something about it. This presentation will examine the digital, cultural and societal aspects of health literacy for people with disabilities. We'll explore the gaps that exist in today's e-health landscape, uncovering the ways that accessibility can bring universal benefit to people of all abilities and backgrounds.</p>
