Designing for inclusion not only means designing for people who have different abilities than us but rather it takes into consideration other factors as socio-economic, race, gender, family dynamics, language etc., which may act as a barrier to interaction. So as designers, the gate-keepers it becomes paramount to find a way to understand the weight of our design decisions and find a way to incorporate different voices in it. Therefore at in-clusivity, we use a tool, “The User Mapping Canvas” which is a visual representation of the user’s abilities required to interact with the design. It lays down the groundwork for the team to understand the broader picture of design systems in various contexts also combined with Cards For Inclusion it creates space for open conversation where biases and pre-existing standards can be challenged.</p>",

That's where I come in. I work with leaders to improve technology decision-making, increase market engagement, and grow operational effectiveness. The result: market-leading products and services that win increasingly diverse markets. In addition to my advisory and volunteer work supporting the next generation of diverse professionals and business leaders, I am CEO at Say Yeah, a digital management consultancy that focuses on bringing inclusive design practices to public and private-sector organizations. When I'm not working, I'm most likely DJing multi-hour-long house music mixes for my next dance party or a long run.</p>",
			"title":"There is no average person; why designing with intersectionality in mind is critical",
			"description":"<p>One of the most common ways to approach product and service objectives is to create personas and conduct research based on 'average' target users. But this approach falls apart when you consider that every person has a variety of shifting needs, identities, and contexts of use. This session will explore the challenges, opportunities, and methods of bringing an intersectional, inclusive approach to your research. Lee will highlight the research behind prioritizing individuals over averages and how inclusive research practices can grow the impact of your work. You'll leave the talk with an improved understanding of markets, new approaches to opening up market access, and insights on how to deliver products and services that better serve increasingly diverse markets.</p>",

			"description":"<p>Blogs and articles discuss testing with a screen reader as being a vitally important part of creating accessible digital experiences. But these same blogs and articles jump into which commands to use in the screen reader and not necessarily what to test or how to interpret the results. It's a little like baking a cake, where you have the ingredients but not the instructions</p><p>A structured approach towards screen reader testing means where time is often limited, our efforts are focused on the critical parts of the digital experience. The things which users will use and interact with rather than the static components like headings and lists which are picked up earlier in the development cycle.</p><p>This approach is ultimately compatibility testing. It's identifying whether unusual behaviour identified in one browser and screen reader combination is due to poor coding practice or a quirk of the combination. It's confirming, if it's coded correctly and tested comprehensively against all the combinations potential problems can be escalated or ignored. We're not chasing our tail fixing behaviour in one combination which is a quirk and not a legitimate bug.</p>",
