It is also within companies, and therefore among industry employees, that we find misunderstandings that oppose and discriminate the most marginalized population.

Not addressing these obstacles wastes a massive source of innovation as it prevents these employees from doing their best work, thereby limiting valuable contribution to the company as a whole. After this talk, you will understand what cognitive disabilities and neurodivergence mean, why it's important to consider, and actionable steps you can take to create a more inclusive Slack and Zoom environment in the workplace.",
