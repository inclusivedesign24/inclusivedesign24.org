<h1>Information for presenters</h1>

<p>Hello <cite>#id24</cite> presenters! As <cite>#id24</cite> approaches, we’ve put together a few bits and pieces for you to help you prepare for the big day.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Please check the time of your talk once again. <cite>#id24</cite> runs on UTC, so depending on where in the world you are, your talk may be at a different time (on Wednesday not Thursday for example). The <a href="https://inclusivedesign24.org/">#id24 website</a> will show the time of your talk based on the time zone you’re currently in.</li>
  <li>Please be in the Slack channel at least 30 minutes before your talk is due to start, and have your slides ready to go promptly on the hour.</li>
  <li>Please keep to time. <cite>#id24</cite> talks run for 40 minutes, followed by a 10-minute question period at the end. We have to allow a 10-minute change-over between talks for the hosts. To keep <cite>#id24</cite> running smoothly, we’ll be strict about finishing talks (including questions) inside of 50 minutes, but it is also important that your talk does not stop too far short of 40 minutes in order to avoid unexpectedly long breaks between talks, so please run through your talk to make sure it fits the expected time.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Presentation content</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Make sure your talk does not include any content (verbal, written, graphical, or otherwise) that may be found directly or indirectly offensive – see our <a href="../code-of-conduct/">code of conduct</a>.</li>
  <li>If your talk includes content (such as images, charts, screenshots, audio/video extracts, quotes) that is not your own, you must provide appropriate attribution/accreditation, both in the slides and during the actual presentation.</li>
  <li>Make sure your presentation is as accessible as possible – this includes making sure that contrast is appropriate, slides don't include excessive/unnecessary motion effects, no flashing/strobing content; during the presentation, be sure to describe any images, video, or audio material used to convey meaning.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Zoom</h2>

<p>We use <a href="https://zoom.us/download">Zoom</a> to broadcast to YouTube live. Because of how this is set up, the host will start your specific Zoom meeting at around 10 minutes to the hour, and invite you to join via the URL we sent you in the days before the conference.</p>

<ul>
  <li>You must complete a tech check by <strong>Friday 12 September</strong> at the latest. You need to do your tech check using the same setup you will use on the day, and from the same location. We will have an open Zoom running the week before for speakers to join. If you’d like an invite, just ping one of the <cite>#id24</cite> team in the Slack channel.</li>
  <li>Do not “Add” attendees from the Zoom URLs. Attendees/viewers will watch via YouTube or via the publicly published URLs on the <cite>#id24</cite> site.</li>
</ul>

<p>If you are unfamiliar with Zoom, here are a few support articles worth reading:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://support.zoom.com/hc/en/getting-started-with-meetings?id=zoom_meetings_guide">Getting started with Zoom meetings</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://support.zoom.com/hc/en/article?id=zm_kb&sysparm_article=KB0060596">Sharing your screen or desktop on Zoom</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://support.zoom.com/hc/en/article?id=zm_kb&sysparm_article=KB0063608">Sharing background music or computer audio on Zoom</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://support.zoom.com/hc/en/article?id=zm_kb&sysparm_article=KB0068635">Screen sharing a PowerPoint presentation</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://support.zoom.com/hc/en/article?id=zm_kb&sysparm_article=KB0068551">Screen sharing a Keynote presentation</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Things to note:</p>

<ul>
  <li>While it is possible to include audio, video, animations and live demos in your presentation, note that any motion that’s very fast may not stream smoothly and get choppy. We’d recommend keeping those to a minimum. If you have audio material, make sure that when you share your screen for the presentation you also enable audio sharing in Zoom.</li>
  <li>Please avoid live coding during your talk.</li>
  <li>When co-presenting with other people, swapping control of the slides between different people often causes logistical problems. We strongly recommend that only one presenter has responsibility for controlling the slides.</li>
  <li>Please turn off all notifications (text messages, social media, Skype etc.) during your presentation.</li>
  <li>Each session will be hosted by at least two people including one <cite>#id24</cite> team member. These teams will be responsible for collecting any audience questions and will ask them to you at the end of your talk. The hosts will be silent for the duration of your talk unless there is a reason for them to interrupt you (for example, if your screen stops sharing or there are connectivity issues)</li>
  <li>The <cite>#id24</cite> hosts will also be responsible for starting and stopping the broadcast. At the beginning of the session they will “Go live” and you can share your screen. They will then mute themselves and the floor will be yours!</li>
</ul>

<h2>Important dates</h2>

<p>Please note these important dates:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Mon 24 August to Fri 11 September 2026</strong> for tech checks</li>
<li><strong>Thu 24 September 2026</strong> is conference day (noting time zone differences – for instance, if you are in the US/Canada, the conference starts on the evening of Wed 23 September) – please be in the Slack channel at least 30 minutes before your allocated time slot, so we can get your presentation set up to start on the hour.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Prerecorded sessions</h2>

<p><cite>#id24</cite> is primarily intended to be a live 24 hour broadcast event. However, we understand that on occasion life gets in the way, and that you may not be able to present live. While in the first instance we will try to rearrange the schedule to find a suitable time slot (if your original slot doesn't work for you anymore), if all else fails we will be able to use a prerecorded version of a talk. We will provide further details for this closer to the time of the event, but this will need to be pre-agreed with the organisers.</p>

<h2>Spread the word!</h2>

<p>We need your help spreading the word about <cite>#id24</cite> around the world. Please share the <cite>#id24</cite> schedule with all your contacts, using the <cite>#id24</cite> hashtag.</p>

<h2>Thank you</h2>

<p>With thanks to our supporters, we are able to offer a modest "thank you" for each session. We will contact you separately with more details.</p>

<p>Thanks for being part of <cite>#id24</cite>. If there is anything else we can do to help, you know where to find us, if not - we’ll see you on the day!</p>
