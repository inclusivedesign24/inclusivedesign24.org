        <span class="session_title">Behind the Mask: The Experience of Hidden Disability</span></h3>
        <a class="videostream" target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wPhXOZmvMk8&index=1&list=PL95LOQw9SLWxmcZtzBiFuT9HAJKFJnl2n" aria-describedby="talk1"><i class="fa fa-play-circle" aria-hidden="true"></i> View video/stream</a>
    <div class="session_details">
        <div class="session_abstract"><p>In this talk, Molly will address challenges of managing what has been termed "hidden disability." Typically, a hidden disability describes an individual who lives with significant accessibility, assistive device and human resource support requirements, but otherwise appears to be "normal." Despite legal protection afforded in most global communities, people with hidden disabilities face a set of unique challenges. Most are based on a simple truth: There is no real measure of human normality. We are diverse by design! Through the human stories Molly will share will be revealed core ways in which individuals who are striving for personal excellence adapt, and not only survive but thrive when afforded the opportunity. What's really behind the masks we've all learned to wear? It's wholly human: The quest to live full, active and productive lives. And, doing so without the constant discrimination and confusion born of human misunderstanding can open up opportunities for technological and social advancement. This talk aims to reveal the realities of what make us "whole"; to authentically and responsibly reveal the truth behind the masks we wear; to facilitate a more egalitarian and safe environment across our world - all this regardless of the way we appear to be!</p></div>
        <h4>About the speaker</h4><div class="session_presenter_bio"><p>Molly E. Holzschlag is a colorful and recognized character working the Web since there was a Web to be worked!

    <div class="session_details">
        <div class="session_abstract"><p>Visual style is often described in contrast to the document semantics defined by HTML tags and ARIA roles.  But in a well-designed website or document, style provides the semantic information to visual users.  It conveys structure, function, and relationships.  Visual designers understand these semantics implicitly, but that knowledge is often not translated into the markup.  As a result, those semantics are not available to non-visual or modified-visual users.  I will demonstrate how the common motifs of visual web design can be translated into accessible markup, by working through some standard web designs, parsing the visual styles into landmarks and headings.</p></div>
        <h4>About the speaker</h4><div class="session_presenter_bio"><p>Amelia Bellamy-Royds is a Renaissance girl, whose education and career have moved sideways from bioinformatics to government science policy to journalism to data visualization to web graphics.  In web development circles, she is mostly known for her work with SVG. She is an Invited Expert on the W3C's SVG and ARIA working groups, and has co-authored <a href="http://www.oreilly.com/pub/au/6190">multiple books on SVG from O’Reilly Media</a>.  One day, she hopes to put her web graphics skills to work making journalistic data visualizations to promote science-based decisions in government policy.  For now, she's focused on improving graphical communication on the web for everyone.</p>

        <div class="session_abstract"><p>I've spent the past 16 months designing how Microsoft assistive technologies would arrive on the Xbox One console. I'll show you the latest Xbox releases of Magnifier, controller remapping, Narrator, and high contrast themes while going through the considerations involving the console's input and output modalities.  Sorry I won't be giving you any spoilers of what is coming up for Xbox, but I will give you my thoughts on how gaming can be inclusive by giving people personalized challenges and game mechanic options that align with their abilities.</p></div>
        <h4>About the speaker</h4><div class="session_presenter_bio"><p>Bryce is a designer at Xbox. Back in his homeland, he designed the first digital library for the Canadian National Institute for the Blind. Now he has the greatest job in the world applying the Microsoft inclusive design practice to gaming.  He is locked in a mutually-assured destruction scenario with the secrets he can tell you about Billy Gregory's youth, but for now he's keeping his mouth shut.</p>

        <div class="session_abstract"><p>A common mistake made by those new to accessibility testing is over applying WCAG. Even though some Success Criteria mention explicit exceptions, they're easy to ignore or forget they even exist. Knowing when not to apply the accessibility checks is just as important as knowing when to apply them. This talk will give an overview of the exceptions in WCAG and provide some examples of when they don't apply.</p></div>

        <div class="session_abstract"><p>Studies indicate that people with disabilities tend to be in poorer health than other patients. In addition, households containing family members with disabilities experience increased economic and logistical barriers when trying to obtain healthy, affordable food. Solving these problems means recognizing the social model of exclusion that prevents fundamental services from reaching low-income and low-access populations. It's a challenge that has inspired new forms of ³design thinking² in the hopes of bridging these accessibility gaps. This session will examine real-world case studies taking place in today's interconnected marketplace from mobile shopping apps to frugal digital innovation that support long-term sustainable benefit for people of all abilities and backgrounds.</p></div>

You’ll learn about what the law has done to increase digital accessibility at the bank, the polling place and the university.  At the diner and at the drug store.  Oh – and at the ballpark. We’ll learn how to speak the language of the law in a positive way.  And how to begin thinking about civil rights law as an accessibility tool.  Yes, like any tool, it can be misused. [We’ll talk a little about that too.] It has its limitations and can’t do everything. But in the right hands (including yours) the law can – and does -- play a role in building an inclusive web.</p></div>
