        <div class="session_presenter_bio"><p>For 30 years, Mike Paciello, founder and president of The Paciello Group,
            has pioneered the field of accessible interface design as a technologist, consultant, author and
            professional speaker. His internationally best-selling book, Web Accessibility for People with Disabilities,
            remains the definitive standard reference for accessibility design, implementation and usability.
            In 2006, Mike, along with colleague Jim Tobias, was appointed co-chair to the United States Federal Access
            Board’s Telecommunications and Electronic and Information Technology Advisory Committee (TEITAC). On April
            3rd 2008, TEITAC presented a historic series of internationally harmonized recommendations that will bridge the gap between
            technology and people with disabilities.</p>

    <div class="session_details">
        <div class="session_abstract"><p>As the Web keeps evolving at a faster pace, accessibility best practices tend to
            lag behind. Something as basic and fundamental as an accessible image can still turn out to be quite a
            challenge when popular development techniques seem to move away from traditional HTML images more and more.
            In this session we will discuss how such changes in web development can negatively affect accessibility,
            particularly in relation to user personalisation tools such as high contrast mode and custom user
            stylesheets. Solutions and workarounds for dealing with such issues will be provided.</p>

    <div class="session_details">
        <div class="session_abstract"><p>Australia adopted WCAG 1.0 in 2000 with great expectations, but the expected
            improvements were limited. When WCAG 2.0 was released, Australia was again an early adopter, endorsing it as
            the coordinated Government standard in 2009. The difference with the adoption of WCAG 2.0 was the
            preparation of national plan for government adoption that has driven extensive activity. Andrew Arch will
            talk about the Australian Government’s experience with implementing web accessibility – where they’ve come
            from, where they’re at, and what the future might hold.</p>

    <div class="session_details">
        <div class="session_abstract"><p>The Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (known as WCAG2.0) are a great resource
            for those building accessible websites. But they can be a bit daunting if you're new to accessibility, or
            not really technical. This talk sets out a series of yes/no questions that anyone can answer about their own
            website to get a feel for the level of accessibility. A couple of free and easy to use tools are introduced
            to help with answering the questions. Whilst the questions don't cover every aspect of web accessibility, if
            you can answer all these questions correctly, your website is going to be more accessible than many.</p>

            centralized and in many ways solved for sites using Drupal.  Although the examples are very specific to this
