<h2>Full version</h2>

<h3>Purpose</h3>
<p>This Code of Conduct describes what we expect from everyone who participates in #id24, and describes what will happen when someone breaks the Code of Conduct.</p>
<p>We ask everyone who takes part in #id24 to help us make it a good and safe experience for everyone.</p>

<h3>Scope</h3>
<p>We expect everyone who takes part in #id24 to comply with this Code of Conduct in all online and offline #id24 venues, and in all online and offline communication relating to #id24. This includes the organisers, sponsors, contributors (paid or otherwise), participants, and guests.</p>
<p>This Code of Conduct also applies to unacceptable behaviour outside of #id24, when such behaviour has the potential to affect the safety and well-being of #id24 participants.</p>

<h3>Recognition</h3>
<p>We want everyone to understand the relationship between their words and actions, and the way the #id24 community works together.</p>
<p>We encourage everyone to take deliberate and positive actions, so the #id24 community does not have the same types of inequality found in society.</p>
<p>If you notice someone who is making an extra effort to make the #id24 community friendly and welcoming, compliment them for their good work. You can do this personally, or by letting the #id24 organisers know.</p>

<h3>Expected behaviour</h3>
<p>We expect everyone who participates in #id24 to:</p>

<li>Be considerate and respectful in your speech and actions.</li>
<li>Try collaboration before conflict.</li>
<li>Avoid demeaning, discriminatory, or harassing speech and behaviour.</li>
<li>Recognise others who make an extra effort to make #id24 friendly, welcoming, and who encourage others to take part.</li>
<li>Be mindful of your surroundings, and of your fellow participants.</li>
<li>Alert the #id24 organisers  if you notice a dangerous situation, someone in distress, or violations of this code of conduct (even if they seem inconsequential).</li>
<li>If attending #id24 in a venue that may be shared with members of the public, be respectful to all patrons at the venue.</li>
</ul>

<li>deliberate mis-use of people's preferred pronouns.</li>

<h3>Consequences</h3>
